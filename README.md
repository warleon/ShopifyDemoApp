# English Version Report

## Design Decisions

### Stack

#### Programing Language: TypeScript

#### Execution Enviroment: Node.js v20.11.0 (Latest at the time)

#### Web Server: Next.js

I have chosen Next.js because it is the framework requested in the job posting.

#### Database: SQLite + Prisma ORM

For the database I decided to use Prisma as the ORM and SQLite as the backend database, just for simplicity

### API Design

For the API I have exposed just three http endpoints, wich are:

- **POST /api/webhook/update_customer**

  > To receive the incoming notifications from **Shopify**

- **POST /api/post/update_customer**

  > To receive the incoming notifications from social media
  > (custom test cases)

- **GET /api/get/send_mail**
  > To send the mail to the
  > **top ten most liked clients** and
  > **top ten most followed clients**
  > (only one email is sent per client if the sets share elements)

#### Struggles

Since **This API** is meant to be used with a **private app** created in the
**Shopify Admin Configuration Panel**
I have encountered an "unsolvable problem" during the development.
that the neither **Shopify Admin API validation utility** nor a
**Custom made validation procedure** made following the documentation for Webhooks validation
are able verify the incoming message due to the inexisting **Client Secret**
available for a **public app** created in the **Shopify Partners Dashboard**

#### Solutions

For the first version of **This API** I, in an optimistic mindset,
left the incomming request pass even if the Hmac validation fails

**TODO make This API Oauth compatible**

## Testing

### Requirements

- Node.js v20.11.0
- ngrok v3.5.0
- VS Code + Thunder Client Extension (For endpoints testing)

the versions are not mandatory, it may run with previous ones

### To run

I will asume that you have:

- A **Shopify Development Store** alredy created.
- A **Shopify Private App** for that store already created with access to its **API Credentials**

Then:

1.  Clone this repository if reading this on Github, else skip this step
1.  Open the current directory (the one that contains this readme.md) on VSCode
1.  Create a `.env.local` file with the following enviroment variables:

    ```
    SHOPIFY_API_KEY=
    SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=
    SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=${SHOPIFY_API_SECRET}
    SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=
    SHOPIFY_APP_URL=
    ```

    And populate `SHOPIFY_API_KEY`, `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`, `SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN` with its corresponding values from the private app **API Credentials**

1.  Open 3 terminals, one for **Next.js**, other for **ngrok**, and other for **Prisma Studio**

1.  On other terminal execute ngrok to create a test tunnel
    ```
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
1.  Copy the link of the **Forwarding** attribute shown in the **Ngrok terminal**
    and paste it as the value of the `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` in the `.env.local` file
1.  Install the project dependencies (npm in my case, you may have another package manager)
    ```
    npm install
    ```
1.
